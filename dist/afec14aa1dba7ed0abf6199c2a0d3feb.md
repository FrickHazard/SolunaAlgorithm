S_n \\}$\n\n* $M(G_\\alpha)$ denotes the **set** of game boards reachable by $G_\\alpha$, by the following two rules\n\n1. Where $H(S_a) = H(S_b)$, $G_\\beta = G_\\alpha - \\{ S_a, S_b \\} \\ + S(H(S_a) + H(S_b), C(S_a))$. We call $S_a$ the *top piece* as its coloring overwrites $S_b$\n\n2. Where $C(S_a) = C(S_b)$, $G_\\beta = G_\\alpha - \\{ S_a, S_b \\} \\ + S(H(S_a) + H(S_b), C(S_a))$. $S_a$.\n\n* The Graph  $V(G)$ is the graph of all Game boards reachable by $M$ over $G$ .\n\n* We define an initial game $I$ as any Game Board $G$ such that $\\forall \\ S \\in G \\ , \\ H(S) = 1$.\n\n* We define an end Game $E$ as any Game Board $G$ such that the cardinality of $M(G)$ is 0 ($M(G)$ is the empty set).\n\n**Lemma 1**:  The graph $V$ of any $G$ is a finite DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and at most has a depth equal to the cardinality of $G$.\n\n**Proof** Since $G$ is finite, and every Game Board  $G_\\alpha \\in M(G)$ has one less stack then $G$, then the graph $V$ has a depth no greater than the cardinalty of $G$, and additionaly must be acyclic since any node may only connect to game state with less nodes.\n\n\n**Lemma 2**\n\nFor any Game Board $G$ there is one and only one $I$, such that $V(I)$ contains $G$ as a node.\n\n**Proof**\n\n**Lemma 3**\n\nAll End Game Boards $E$ can be represenetd as a *partition with distinct parts*, where every piece is colored differently.\n\n\n\nWe prove two types of move graph isomorphisms\n\n**1.**\n\nSymbol Irrelevance, Given a gameboard $A$, Consider any gameboard $B$ where every subset of symbol pieces are swapped with a different symbol such that no two subsets are switched with the same symbol.\n\nAny move(edge) in $A$ is either a move onto a piece with the same height or a move onto a piece with the same symbol.\n\nIn either case a corresponding move may be made in $B$.\n\nLeft -> Heights are the identical between $A$ and $B$,\nRight -> Any move onto the same symbol in $A$ will have a corresponding same symbol in $B$.\n\nThus their is an edge correspondance between $A$ and $B$.\n\nBy induction, any corresponding move(edge) between $A$ and $B$ applied, will result in two boards matching the criteria for corresponding edges, therefore $A \\simeq B$\n\n\n**2.**\n\n$\\forall \\ G \\ , \\ V(G) \\simeq V(G_\\beta)$, where $G_\\beta = \\{ \\ \\ (H(S) \\ /  \\ \\gcd(\\{ \\ H(S) \\ | \\ S \\in G \\ \\}) \\ , \\ C(S)) \\ | \\ S \\in G \\ \\}$.\n\nIn other words the graph $V$ of any Game Board $G$ is isomorphic to the same board where every stacks's height is divide by the gcd of all stack's heights.\n**Proof**\n\nHeight Move: Since Every $S \\in G_\\beta$ has the same number $c = (\\min(\\{ \\ H(S) \\ | \\ S \\in G \\ \\}) -1)$, subtracted from its height, any height move in $G \\implies$ a height move in $G_\\beta$.\n\nColor Move: As colors are unchanged this is trivial.\n\nTherefore there is a $1-1$ correspondance between $M(G)$ and $M(G_\\beta)$.\n\nNow we must prove the induction step, Again the color move case is trivial as colors are identical.\n\nFor height moves consider the following, the corresponding height move $i$ of $M(G)_i$ and $M(G_\\beta)_i$, the height of the new stack $H(\\overline{S}_\\beta)$ of $M(G_\\beta)_i = H(\\overline{S}) + 2c$, for the new stack $\\overline{S}$ of $M(G)_i$.";
